# Pipeline-Elevation-Profile
 The Pipeline Elevation Profile Mapping Project aims to create a comprehensive and visually intuitive representation of the elevation profile along a pipeline route. This project leverages Geographic Information System (GIS) technologies to generate detailed elevation profiles, which are then saved and shared in the Keyhole Markup Language (KMZ) file format.
